           MARTINE ROSE SS21 
        </div>
        Yes, I did model in Paris Fashion Week. I worked with U.K. menswear designer 
        <a href="https://martine-rose.com/">Martine Rose</a> and her team on their SS21 virtual show. 
        It was a surreal, super cool experience, and I get a lot of questions about it. 

        <br><br>
        Long story short - I used to take daily pictures 
        of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/turdjournal/">my outfits on Instagram.</a> 
        A casting agency found the account and reached out 
        asking if I was interested in modeling. Duh, I said yes. Then, I worked with Martine Rose 
        and her team to coordinate the shoot. I set up a tripod and filmed myself hanging out in my room
        in pieces from her Spring/Summer 2021 collection.

        This is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnZM9NJzuTM">a great video about the shoot!</a>
