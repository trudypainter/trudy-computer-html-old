            REAL TALK RADIO
        </div>
        For the summer of 2020, I worked on Real Talk Radio under
         <a href="https://studioijeoma.com/"> Ekene Ijeoma</a> with 
         <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/poetic-justice/overview/">the Poetic Justice Group at the MIT Media Lab.</a>

        <br><br>
        
        Real Talk Radio is a continuous broadcasting system. It contains spoken word song introductions in 
        Black music from hip hop to jazz as a form of Black thought and knowledge. 
        These introductions  often include personal musings filled with inspiration, insight, and spirituality.
        <br><br>

        I worked as a music researcher and web developer for this project. I [1] curated over 500 song clips, 
        [2] coded a broadcasting system to stream and crossfade the clips, and [3] created a Python backend 
        automation system to update human curator changes and leveraged Google Sheets to create a custom API for the frontend stream.

        This project has not been released to the public yet. However, below is a project overview diagram. You can also watch a demo
